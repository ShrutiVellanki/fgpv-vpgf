TODO:
- Figure out how to add Panels as Panel contents [9:00 - 10:00]
- Remove unnescessary alerts, double check JSDocs
- For each new method --> JSDoc comments
- Make Panel pretty [10:00 - 10:30]
  -pretty background + border for controls

- Get open/close button of panel as first control (+/-) [11:30 - 2:00] (Pod meeting)
- Set content panel overflow [works?]
-Elements --> user defined ids?
- panel element ids according to main panel as well?
-Change panelelem shell to be there in PanelElem class
*********************************************************************************************************

-JQUERY<HTMLElement> for PanelElem



    //This mimics addPanel function to be added to map API --> would subscribe to panelAdded
    //notice how rest of functions need to be nestled into "AddPanel"
    //Really, addPanel in mapAPI would have parameters with ID, controls

    //1. Construct new panels (want construction to be separate from adding)
    //2. Have panels add themselves to document when add panel button is clicked on
    //3. Problem --> if user sets height/width etc before adding panel to map?
    //4. For testing purposes:
    //construct three different panels
    //on add panel lightyear --> trigger addPanel method
    //on add panel aldrin --> trigger addPanel method
    //on add panel skywalker --> trigger addPanel method




    //BUTTON TO BE CONTAINED WITHIN PANEL API
    /*$("#ClosePanel").click(function () {
        if (document.getElementById("ClosePanel").innerHTML == "Close Panel") {
                newPanel.close();
            }
            else {
                newPanel.open();
            }

        });*/
