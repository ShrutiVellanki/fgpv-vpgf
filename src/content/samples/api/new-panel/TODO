TODO:
- Figure out issue with setting visibility for PanelElems [8:00 - 9:00]
- Figure out how to add Panels as Panel contents [9:00 - 10:00]
- Remove unnescessary alerts, double check JSDocs
- For each new method --> JSDoc comments
- Make Panel pretty [10:00 - 10:30]
  -pretty background + border
  -pretty background + border for each elem/new panel added
  -User defined IDs? Btn, PanelElem etc. 
- Figure out how to separate PanelElem and Button Elem [10:30 - 11:30]
- Get open/close button of panel as first control (+/-) [11:30 - 2:00] (Pod meeting)

-Test SVG icon Btn for SVG objects --> ask Miles to verify what he means by "SVG Object"


Problem: -should Btns have a function option? Should they be in Controls?
         -esp if they are controls, would be helpful for them to refer to the panel instance they are in
          to control the behaviour of the panel 
         -user is defining functions of Btns, PanelElems, Panels
         -So Btns, PanelElems, Panels in Panel Body --> would probably have nothing to do with panel itself --> showcasing external data
            -functions wouldn't need to be defined for these?
        -Well Panels, Btns and PanelElems are all HTMLElements so if user wants to define their function    
            -They could just get ID
            -get element by ID
            -Do something like onclick blah blah
        
        -For my open/close button --> Once panel is constructed all the buttons will be "on screen"
        -At that point getElementById for open/close button
            --> btn.onclick:
                open if "Open Text"
                close if "Close Text" 
        -if you're changing object ID in Panel Constructor --> change the attribute for the PanelElem  or Btn
            -remember user only gets ID from class name

-JQUERY<HTMLElement> for PanelElem



    //This mimics addPanel function to be added to map API --> would subscribe to panelAdded
    //notice how rest of functions need to be nestled into "AddPanel"
    //Really, addPanel in mapAPI would have parameters with ID, controls

    //1. Construct new panels (want construction to be separate from adding)
    //2. Have panels add themselves to document when add panel button is clicked on
    //3. Problem --> if user sets height/width etc before adding panel to map?
    //4. For testing purposes:
    //construct three different panels
    //on add panel lightyear --> trigger addPanel method
    //on add panel aldrin --> trigger addPanel method
    //on add panel skywalker --> trigger addPanel method




    //BUTTON TO BE CONTAINED WITHIN PANEL API
    /*$("#ClosePanel").click(function () {
        if (document.getElementById("ClosePanel").innerHTML == "Close Panel") {
                newPanel.close();
            }
            else {
                newPanel.open();
            }

        });*/
